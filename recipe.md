HOW TO MAKE YEAST:

Take yeast,flour and sugar(or maple syrup). It must be in room temperature so keep these ingridents out of fridge before 1 hour 
First pour half cup of luke warm water to a large mixing bowl. Cheak wether the water is warm and is not hot else the dough will not rise 
Add 1 teaspoon of yeast (3 grams) to the warm water. If you  prefer low yeast,it will rise slowly then add 1/3 teaspoon of yeast (1 gram)
Add 1 teaspoon of raw sugar or maple syrup. Avoid using refined sugar
Stir it slowly and gently. Allow it to rest undisturbed for 10 to 12 minutes
The mixture will turn frothy and bubbly. If it fails do not continue further. Throw away the yeast and start making a new yeast mixture.

MAKING DOUGH:

When yeast turns frothy, add 2 1/2 cup of flour (300 grams), 1/3 teaspoon salt and 1 1/2 tablespoon olive oil.(I have taken organic all purpose flour. You can also use 1 cup of all purpose flour and 1 1/2 cup of fine wheat flour)
Mix all of them to form a dough. You will need more water (about 2 to 3 spoons extra) so add acordingly till it forms a smooth and non sticky dough. I the dough is sticky then add more flour to it  
Knead the dough for 4 to 5 minutes. Use the heel of yur hand to keand the dough. At the end the dough should be soft and when you poke into it it should be dent and bounce back slowly. If so then the dough is ready

PROOFING DOUGH:

Shape the dough into a ball and then apply a thin layer of oil to prevent the dough from drying. Also grease the bowl with some oil
Cover the bowl with a moist napkin or lid. Rest at room temperature till the dough bacomes double its size.(It may take 1 to 4 hours. Dont depent on the hours. Wait till the dough becomes double its size.)

MAKING PIZZA SAUCE:

Pour 400 to 500 grams of tomato into a blender. Heat 1 1/2 tablespoon of oil in a pan and add 2 finely chopped garlic cloves (about 1 table spoon). Fry the garlic till a aroma comes. Then add 1 teaspoon of chilli flakes.
Pour the blended tomato. Add 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of sugar. Stir well
Cover the pot partially and cook untill the tomatoes cook down and reduce to a thick consistensy (be caefull as the tomato may splash a lot.) Occasionally reduce the flame and give a good mix.
When the mixture thickens like a sauce, add 1 teaspoon of italian herbs and 1/2 teaspoon of crushed pepper. Taste the sauce and add more herbs,pepper and salt accordingly 
The consistency must be thick and spreading. If its watery and running the pizza will be wet and soaked (cool it completely and transfer to a jar if using later)

PREPARING VEGGIES:

Preapare the veggis and grate the chesse. We are using onions, bell pepper,mushroom and olives. You  can use anything you prefer(if you are using bottled olives drain them to a small strainer)

PIZZA BASE (THIN CRUST):

Once the dough is ready it will consisit of air bubbles. Transfer it to a work space and punch down to deflat and remove air bubbles.
Divide into 2 to 3 parts depending upon the size you want
Keand the pieces and make it in a shape of a ball
If the dough ball is ready prepare the oven to its highest temperature.
Sprinkle some cornmeal on the tray and place the dough on the tray, Fatten it with ypur fingers. Add few drops of oil
Start to speard and streach the dough. You can flatten the base according to your wish. Keep the edges thicker than the center.

PREPARING THE PIZZA:

Spread the pizza sauce we prepared eairlier as desired.
Then layer the grated cheese and add veigges. Then add more grated cheese if you want. Then add Italian herbs and chilly flakes as preferred.
Then keep the pizza in the oven for 8 to 10 minutes. Wait till the cheese melts and and the crust becomes golden color.
Take the pizza out of the oven and wait till it cools down
Cut the pizza and it is ready to be served.
